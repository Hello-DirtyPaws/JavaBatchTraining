# Task 5: Classes and Objects

1. Print the sum, difference and product of two complex numbers by creating a class named 'Complex' with separate methods for each operation whose real and imaginary parts are entered by user.<br>

2. Write a program that would print the information (name, year of joining, salary, address) of three employees by creating a class named 'Employee'. The output should be as follows:
<img src="./Employees.png" width="350">

3. Write a program to print the names of students by creating a Student class. If no name is passed while creating an object of Student class, then the name should be "Unknown", otherwise the name should be equal to the String value passed while creating object of Student class.<br>
(Hint: Overloading concept)<br>

4. Create a class named 'Rectangle' with two data members- length and breadth and a method to calculate the area which is 'length*breadth'. The class has three constructors which are : <br>
1 - having no parameter - values of both length and breadth are assigned zero.<br>
2 - having two numbers as parameters - the two numbers are assigned as length and breadth respectively.<br>
3 - having one number as parameter - both length and breadth are assigned that number.<br>
Now, create objects of the 'Rectangle' class having none, one and two parameters and print their areas.<br>

5. Suppose you have a Saving Box with an initial amount of $50 and you have to add some more to it. Create a class 'AddAmount' with a data member named 'amount' with an initial value of $50. Now make two constructors of this class as follows:<br>
1 - without any parameter - no amount will be added to the Saving Box<br>
2 - having a parameter which is the amount that will be added to Saving Box<br>
Create object of the 'AddAmount' class and display the final amount in Saving Box. Also, create a method that can display how many transactions are done on the Saving Box.<br>

6. Create a class named 'Programming'. While creating an object of the class, if nothing is passed to it, then the message "I love programming languages" should be printed. If some String is passed to it, then in place of "programming languages" the name of that String variable should be printed.<br>
For example, while creating object if we pass "Java", then "I love Java" should be printed. There can be more than one programming languages.<br>
