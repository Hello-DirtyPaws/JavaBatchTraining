# Task 2: Operators and Decision Making Statements

1. Write a program in JAVA to perform the following operation:<br>
● If a number is divisible by 3 it should print “Consultadd” as a string<br>
● If a number is divisible by 5 it should print “JAVA Training” as a string<br>
● If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5 it should print “Consultadd JAVA Training” as a string.<br>
<br>

2. Write a program in JAVA to perform the following operator based task:<br>
● Ask user to choose the following option first:<br>
○ If User Enter 1 - Addition<br>
○ If User Enter 2 - Subtraction<br>
○ If User Enter 3 - Division<br>
○ If User Enter 4 - Multiplication<br>
○ If User Enter 5 - Average<br>
● Ask user to enter the 2 numbers in a variable for first and second(first and second are variable names) for the first 4 options mentioned above and print the result.<br>
● Ask user to enter two more numbers as first1 and second2 for calculating the average as soon as user choose an option 5.<br>
● At the end if the answer of any operation is Negative print a statement saying “Oops option X(1/2/3/4/5/) is returning the negative number”.<br>
● NOTE: At a time user can perform one action at a time.<br>
<br>

3. Write a program in JAVA to implement the given flowchart:<br>
<br>


4. Write a program in JAVA to break and continue if the following cases occurs:<br>
● If user enters a negative number just break the loop and print “It’s Over”<br>
● If user enters a positive number just continue in the loop and print “Good Going”<br>
<br>

5. Write a program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6.<br>
Expected output: 0 1 2 4 5<br>
<br>

6. Given an integer , perform the following conditional actions:<br>
● If is odd, print NEW<br>
● If is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5 , print OLD<br>
● If is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 30, print NEW<br>
● If is even and greater than 30, print OLD<br>
Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not is weird.<br>
<br>

7. Write a Java program that reads a floating-point number and prints "zero" if the number is zero. Otherwise, print "positive" or "negative". Add "small" if the absolute value of the number is less than 1, or "large" if it exceeds 1,000,000.<br>

8. Write a JAVA program which takes character input from the user,<br>
● If the character is from r, a, n, d, o, m (consider both upper and lower cases), then print FOUND.<br>
● Print NOT FOUND for all the other alphabets.<br>
